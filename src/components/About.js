            A beginner coder with a mission of reaching out to other coders out
            there to build an application that could bring the world together. I
            am always willing to learn new things, new skills and new knowledge
            in order to share it with others and encourage others to contribute
            to a more ethical and secure coding experience.

            <b>My Story</b>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            I love learning new skills. I am also happy to meet other people who
            are exploring and challenging the limits of what they can do. I
            believe that there is no limit to learning. I have an old background
            in software development. I used to code using Visual Basic. It was
            the only programming language I know when I graduated college since
            we used it heavily on our thesis. I remember how eager I was to
            solve a logical problem when I am dealing with programs. I was also
            given the chance to teach it and help students get through their
            thesis in college. I migrated to the United States in 2009 and it
            took me a while to get my feet back into the IT industry. I worked
            in the Consulting Industry for over 5 years, working in IT and
            Security Compliance.{" "}

          <p align="justify">
            Aside from wanting to just learn new skills or updating my old
            skills, my passion is also to create things. Coding allows you to do
            such that. I believe that any person who would like to learn coding
            can also incorporate their other interest into building something
            that is useful to others. I know that we all have the capacity to
            learn coding and other things that we put our dedication into. We
            should never stop learning. We should always have the propensity to
            reach out to others not only for help but also to collaborate.
            Creating something usable and coming up with new and amazing ideas
            can always be fun when you work with other talented people. This is
            why i am here, doing my best to code and take on the challenges of
            it as a very difficult skill to learn. And of course, I remind
            myself at all times, that everything is possible, even the
            impossible.{" "}

            <b>My Occupation</b>
          </p>
          <p align="justify">
            I am currently working as a Cybersecurity Analyst at a retail
            company. I am enjoying this job and I would like to expand my skills
            in the software development in order to combine it with my current
            skills therefore strengthening my aspirations of creating things
            that would provide protection of human data and privacy. My goal is
            to continue learning programming as much as I can. I always love to
            be a beginner. I treat myself as a beginner at all times in order
            for me to transfer the knowledge and skills to anyone with much more
            patience and eagerness. Aside from computing, I also have a passion
            for art. I love drawing, painting with mediums such as gouache, oil
            paint and colored pencil. I am also an aspiring artist. I do have a
            long way to go in this industry. However, I only do it as a hobby.{" "}
